# AvaDisPro

**AvaDisPro** (Probability Distribution Selection Assistant) is the final project developed by **Claudio Kinzel** for the **Computer Science program (emphasis in Systems Analysis)** at **Unisinos (Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos)**, under the guidance of **Professor Ernesto Lindstaedt**.

AvaDisPro is a support tool for selecting probability distributions. Given an initial data set, AvaDisPro reads the data, classifies it into intervals, and performs the **Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov (K-S)** and **Chi-Square** tests to determine whether the data follows a known probability distribution.
